### useTransition

React Hook that lets you update the state without blocking the UI

- useTransition does not take any parameters.
- useTransition returns an array with exactly two items:
  1. isPending flag that tells you whether there is a pending transition
  2. startTransition function that lets you mark a state update as a transition

```
import { useTransition } from 'react';

function TabContainer() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');

  function selectTab(nextTab) {
    startTransition(() => {
      setTab(nextTab);
    });
  }
}
```

The startTransition function returned by useTransition lets you mark a state update as a transition

## üõ†Ô∏è Trouble Shooting

### Parsing error: Cannot find module 'next/babel'

Solution: <p>
Create file called .babelrc in your root directory and add this code:

```
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": []
}
```

And in .eslintrc.json, replace the existing code with:

```
{
  "extends": ["next/babel","next/core-web-vitals"]
}
```

### You are using Node.js 18.16.0. For Next.js, Node.js version >= v18.17.0 is required.

need to update Node.js version to at least v18.17.0

### "next/font" requires SWC although Babel is being used due to a custom babel config being present.

Solution: delete .babelrc

### No utility classes were detected in your source files. If this is unexpected, double-check the `content` option in your Tailwind CSS configuration.

Solution:

```
  in tailwind.config.js

    "./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",

    to

    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",

```

### Error: useRef only works in Client Components.

Solution : Add the "use client" directive at the top of the file to use it

### Unhandled Runtime Error: Image with src "/github-icon.png" is missing required "width" property.

Solution:

Add width and height properties to the Image component. If you don't know the actual size of the image, you can use the layout="fill" attribute to set the image to fill the size of the parent element.

When referencing files in the public directory in Next.js, make sure to use absolute paths that start with a / (forward slash).

```
<Link href="https://github.com/yuhyunjeong/">
  <div className="relative w-14 h-14">
    <Image src="/github-icon.png" alt="Github Icon" layout="fill" />
  </div>
</Link>
```
